        <h3>If anyone ever asks you to visit a planet made entirely of shrimp,<br>
        you can offically say you've done it!<br><br>
        By visiting this site, "A Planet Made Entirely of Shrimp",<br>
        you have visited a planet entirely made of shrimp!  Good job friend!<br>
        This clearly applies to contests that would require you to do the near impossible task of visiting a planet made entirely of shrimp.<br>
        I bet they didn't think it existed, but aren't they in for a big surprise!</h3>
